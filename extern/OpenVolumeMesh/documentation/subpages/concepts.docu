\section halfedges From Half-Edges to Half-Faces

The concepts of %OpenVolumeMesh are closely related to those of %OpenMesh (http://www.openmesh.org).
For further reading on the concepts of %OpenMesh, refer to \cite Botsch02OpenMesh.
%OpenMesh is used to handle two-manifold geometric meshes. For this purpose, it distinguishes
between \e vertices, \e edges, and \e faces. The main idea in %OpenMesh is to represent the
edges as a pair of so-called half-edges that have opposing orientations. Additional local incidence
information is stored for each half-edge such that the navigation on the mesh can be completely
accomplished by using only these local links to adjacent structures (similar to e.g. a linked list).
This, of course, assumes the surface mesh to be two-manifold.
 
The main concept of %OpenVolumeMesh is slightly different but shares some of its ideas with
%OpenMesh. In order to represent volumetric meshes (three-manifolds) that consist of a
set of polyhedra, %OpenVolumeMesh extends the set of entities by \e cells.
But unlike in the original idea of half-edge data structure,
in %OpenVolumeMesh all entities are stored in arrays (STL vectors) rather than
in incidence linked lists. This is why %OpenVolumeMesh is index-based which
has the major advantage that the data structure can handle configurations that are
not three-manifold (since this is desired in some applications).
For example, a set of vertices or just a two-manifold surface can be respresented by
%OpenVolumeMesh as well as an entirely three-manifold polyhedral mesh.
In order to offer the possibility to locally navigate on the meshes, we carry over
the idea of splitting edges into half-edges to the faces. This leads to the separation
of the faces into pairs of so-called half-faces. Each of the half-faces has opposite
orientation to its counter-part and can be either incident to a cell or not which
makes the half-face a boundary half-face. The orientation of a half-face is uniquely determined
by its incident half-edges. See Figure 1 for an illustration of this concept.

\section incidences Incidence Relations

The entities in %OpenVolumeMesh are arranged hierarchically and we distinguish between
two incidence relations:

\li The (intrinsic) top-down incidences and
\li the bottom-up incidences.

\subsection top_down The Top-Down Incidence Relation

Each entity of dimension n is defined as a tuple of entities of dimension n-1,
except for the vertices. So, edges are defined as a pair of vertices, (half-)faces are defined as
a j-tuple of (half-)edges, where j is the valence of the face, and cells are defined
as a k-tuple of (half-)faces, where k is the valence of the cell. This incidence
relation is intrinsically given by definition. %OpenVolumeMesh can use these
incidences in order to provide \e top-down circulators, that is circulators
that address all adjacent lower-dimensional entities of a given reference entity.
Read more on iterators and circulators in Section \ref iterators_and_circulators. 
Figure 2 illustrates this hierarchy.

\subsection bottom_up The Bottom-Up Incidence Relation

In many cases, the incidence list to higher dimensional entities for a given entity is
required. Therefore, %OpenVolumeMesh offers the opportunity to explicitly compute
the so-called \e bottom-up incidences. For this, %OpenVolumeMesh stores the
following information for the respective entity type in additional caches:

\li \b Vertex: A list of all outgoing half-edges.
\li \b Half-Edge: An (ordered) list of all incident half-faces.
\li \b Half-Face: The handle to an incident cell or none if it is a boundary half-face.

These incidence relations are computed automatically for each affected entity
when adding/deleting it. In most cases these incidences are needed since many
iterators/circulators rely on them. Storing this additional information consumes
extra memory that scales linearly with the mesh's complexity.
However, in case these incidence relations are not needed (e.g. in numerical analysis
applications, etc.), they can be disabled by calling TopologyKernel::enable_bottom_up_incidences()
and passing false as parameter. Also it is possible to enable bottom-up incidences
for single entity types, just call the following functions:

\li TopologyKernel::enable_vertex_bottom_up_incidences()
\li TopologyKernel::enable_edge_bottom_up_incidences()
\li TopologyKernel::enable_face_bottom_up_incidences()

This is useful in cases where only a subset of these incidence relations is required
while at the same time keeping the data structure as compact as possible
allocating only a minimum of storage overhead.

\note Note that most of the iterators and circulators rely on these incidence lists, so, many of them do not work if bottom-up incidences are disabled.

\section modularity Modularity - Take only what you need

There exist numerous applications for volumetric mesh data structures including
mesh generation, finite element analysis, rendering, etc. Each of them focussing
on different design goals such as maximum efficiency, compactness or
comfortable navigation. Since our data structure claims to be versatile,
it is designed to be as modular as possible such that it suits many of the
mentioned application cases. Figure 3 shows the class diagram of the core components
of %OpenVolumeMesh. With this architecture it is possible to only instanciate
what is really needed in a particular use case. For instance, we make a clear distinction
between the geometry and topology of a mesh, such that the choice of whether a mesh (graph) requires
a geometric embedding or not is up to the user. This may save a lot of unnecessary memory
overhead in cases where only topological information of a mesh is needed.
The topology kernel implements only a minimal set of (intrinsic) operations on
a mesh such as adding/deleting entities, computing incidence relations and instantiate
iterator objects. All other additional functions are provided by the so-called attribute classes
which are presented in the next section.

\section index_based Using handles to address the entities of a mesh

%OpenVolumeMesh is an index-based data structure where generally all entities
are stored in linear memory arrays (STL vectors). So, each of the entities
is uniquely defined through its handle which is a simple class that encapsulates
the index of it in the respective array it is stored in. This makes sure
the entities can be accessed in \f$O(1)\f$. Each of the distinct entity
types has its own type-safe handle class in order to avoid ambiguity when accessing
elements at compile time. The handle classes are each derived from a common
base class called OpenVolumeMesh::OpenVolumeMeshHandle. The iterators as well
as the circulators are designed to return a handle to an entity on dereference
rather than a reference to the entity itself. A special constant,
OpenVolumeMesh::TopologyKernel::InvalidVertexHandle, etc., for each entity
is used when trying to access non-existing entities.

\section genericity Genericity

\subsection generic_embedding Generic Embedding

The %OpenVolumeMesh library is designed to be as generic as possible. So, at one hand,
the developer can choose the vector space into which a mesh is embedded. For example,
most instances require their vertices being elements of \f$\mathrm{R}^3\f$.
But in some cases, one might want e.g. two-dimensional integer coordinates,
so elements in \f$\mathrm{N}_0^2\f$. In %OpenVolumeMesh, the embedded vector
type can be specified as template parameter. The library is shipped with a vector
class that also specifies all necessary operations on vectors (such as dot- and cross-product,
several norms, etc.). The most common vector types are predefined in VectorT.hh.
So, let's say we want to create a polyhedral mesh whose vertices are elements of
\f$\mathrm{N}_0^2\f$. We use the following code:

\code
#include <OpenVolumeMesh/Geometry/VectorT.hh>
#include <OpenVolumeMesh/Mesh/PolyhedralMesh.hh>

void SomeClass::someFunction() {

  ...

  // Our two-dimensional integer vector class
  typedef OpenVolumeMesh::Geometry::Vec2ui Vec2ui;

  // Vec2ui stands for "two-dimensional vector of unsigned integers"

  // Our mesh using Vec2ui as vector type
  OpenVolumeMesh::GeometryKernel< Vec2ui > myMesh;

  ...

}
\endcode

\subsection generic_properties Generic Dynamic Properties

Similar to the %OpenMesh data structure, it is possible to attach multiple dynamic properties
to any of the entities in %OpenVolumeMesh at run-time. The underlying property container class makes
use of C++ template programming concepts in order to allow the encapsulated property data
to be of any data type. However, we have adapted and improved the property concept of OpenMesh
such that the allocation of properties is now completely managed by a resource
manager implemented in OpenVolumeMesh::ResourceManager. Properties are now allocated
and returned as a shared pointer that automatically are destroyed and entirely released
once they loose scope. This drastically improves the ease-of-use at one hand and
demands less care about memory management at the other hand. Nevertheless, properties
may also (in analogy to the property system of OpenMesh) be declared persistent.
When declaring a property persistent, the ownership of the property memory is given back
to the mesh (from the user context) which makes sure it is not destroyed before
the mesh is. Let's assume, we want to attach a label to the vertices and
some real valued weight to the edges of a mesh. Consider the following example code:

\code
#include <string>

#include <OpenVolumeMesh/Geometry/VectorT.hh>
#include <OpenVolumeMesh/PolyhedralMesh/PolyhedralMesh.hh>

void SomeClass::someFunction {

  ...

  // Create mesh
  typedef OpenVolumeMesh::Geometry::Vec3d Vec3d;
  OpenVolumeMesh::GeometryKernel< Vec3d > myMesh;

  // Fill mesh
  ...

  // Attach label property (data type std::string) to the mesh
  OpenVolumeMesh::VertexPropertyT< std::string > label =
  		myMesh.request_vertex_property< std::string >("LabelProperty");

  // Fill property values
  for(OpenVolumeMesh::VertexIter v_it = myMesh.vertices_begin();
        v_it != myMesh.vertices_end(); ++v_it) {

    // Assign same label to each vertex
    label[*v_it] = "My Label";
  }
  
  // Now, attach weight property (data type float) to the mesh
  OpenVolumeMesh::EdgePropertyT< float > weight =
  		myMesh.request_edge_property< float >(); // Also anonymous properties are supported

  // Fill property values
  for(OpenVolumeMesh::EdgeIter e_it = myMesh.edges_begin();
        e_it != myMesh.edges_end(); ++e_it) {

    // Assign same weight to each edge
    weight[*e_it] = 3.14f;
  }

  // The properties are automatically released
  // when leaving scope
}
\endcode

\section attribs Using attributes to provide extra functionality

Due to the fact that %OpenVolumeMesh is designed to be as compact as possible providing
the opportunity to only use code that is really needed in a particular case, all extra
functionality can be suspended to so-called attribute classes. In this context,
attributes are not to be understood as those used in the C++ STL concepts.
Attribute objects in %OpenVolumeMesh are objects instanciated at run-time which
expect a mesh reference to be injected.
Usually they request a certain set of properties from the mesh and provide
functions that allow operating on these properties or the mesh itself.
The major advantage of the use of these attributes is that they exclusively
use additional memory during their life-time cycle. As soon as an attribute object
looses scope and is thus destroyed, all allocated memory is automatically released again.
The following lines of code show how to use attributes (in this case the
status attribute providing functions for selecting, tagging and deleting
entities):

\code
// Create mesh object
GeometricPolyhedralMeshV3d myMesh;

// Fill mesh with entities
...

// Create status attribute object
StatusAttrib status(myMesh);

// Select vertex with handle 0
status[VertexHandle(0)].set_selected(true);
\endcode
